# Reinforcement Learning for pathfinding in Matlab

This Matlab framework includes a gridworld and a reinforcement learning approach to learn how to navigate in this gridworld.

## Description

The generalimformation about the aim of this project is given in [`Gridworls_Coursework.pdf`](Gridworlds_Coursework1.pdf). The gridworld dynamics is provided by the [`PersonalisedGridWorld.p`](PersonalisedGridWorld.p) file, it is non readable and should not be changed (just to be used in the code to generate the gridworld). The reinforcement learning approach was implemented in [`Coursework1.m`](Coursework1.m) file. The results of the implementation is given in [`CourseworkReport.pdf`](CourseworkReport.pdf)
